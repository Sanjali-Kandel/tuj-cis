/**
 * PROJECT EULER #73
 * Counting Fractions in a Range
 *
 * Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n < d
 * and GCF(n,d) = 1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
 *
 * If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order
 * of size, we get:
 *
 * 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, ... , 7/8
 *
 * It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.
 *
 * How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced
 * proper fractions for d ≤ 12000?
