/**
 * PROJECT EULER #99
 * Largest Exponential
 *
 * Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2¹¹ and 3⁷ is not
 * difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2¹¹ = 2048 < 3⁷ = 2187.
 *
 * However, confirming that 632382⁵¹⁸⁰⁶¹ > 519432⁵²⁵⁸⁰⁶ would be much more
 * difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
 *
 * Using data/euler99.txt, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with
 * a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the
 * greatest numerical value.
