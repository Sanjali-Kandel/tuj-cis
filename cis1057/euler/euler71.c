/**
 * PROJECT EULER #71
 * Ordered Fractions
 *
 * Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n < d
 * and GCF(n,d) = 1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
 *
 * If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order
 * of size, we get:
 *
 * 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, ... , 7/8
 *
 * It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
 *
 * By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1000000 in ascending
 * order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
