 * Cubic Permutations
 *
 * The cube, 41063625 (= 345³), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:
 * 56623104 (= 384³) and 66430125 (= 405³). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest
 * cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
 *
 * Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits
 * are cube.
